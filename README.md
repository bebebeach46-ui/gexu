## ✨ What Makes Gexu Unique?

**Gexu** adds powerful AI capabilities on top of the solid Mihon foundation. Here is everything new:

### 🤖 AI-Powered Intelligence
- **In-Reader Chat:** Ask questions about the plot, characters, or lore *while reading*, without leaving the page.
- **Visual Intelligence (Circle-to-Search):** Select any part of an image to ask "Who is this?" or "Translate this SFX".
- **26 Smart Tools:** The AI can query your library. Ask: "How many hours have I read this month?", "Show me manga like Solo Leveling", or "What chapters have I bookmarked?".
- **Semantic Search:** Don't remember the title? Describe the plot: *"The one where the guy gets reincarnated as a slime"* and Gexu will find it using local vector embeddings.
- **Anti-Spoiler Engine:** The AI knows exactly where you are in the story and **refuses** to spoil future events.
- **Knowledge Base (RAG):** Indexes your library locally for offline, privacy-first context.
- **Hybrid Embeddings:** Uses Google's Gemini Cloud embeddings (high precision) + MediaPipe On-Device embeddings (offline).

### 📖 Enhanced Reading Experience
- **Novel Mode:** Advanced reader for Light Novels and PDFs.
- **Live OCR:** Extract text from images instantly using Google MLKit.
- **Reading Buddy:** The AI automatically generates summaries of chapters as you read, helping you catch up if you drop a series.
- **PDF Smart Reflow:** Native MuPDF integration allows reading PDF manga/novels with text reflow, TOC navigation, and dark mode.
- **Two-Way Viewing:** Switch between original Pages (Image) and Extracted Text (Reader) mode instantly.

### 📝 Deep Organization
- **Smart Notes:** Attach notes to specific pages or chapters.
- **Tag System:** Categorize notes with tags like `Theory`, `Favorite`, `Question`, `Important`.
- **Global Search:** Search through all your notes and tags instantly.
- **Backup & Restore:** All notes and AI settings are preserved in `.tachibk` backups.
